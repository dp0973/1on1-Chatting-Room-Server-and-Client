Your 8080 port must be opened while using this.

Once you connect to the server by client, you can chat to everyone in Global Chat.
When you enter or make a chatting room, you quit Global Chat so that you can only see your oppenent's chat, and vice versa. (Local Chat)

Commands below:

- /createroom - Creates your own room and quits Global Chat. You cannot use this while you are already in a room.

- /joinroom - Joins someone's room. You cannot use this when that room already has an opponent.

- /disconnnect - Disconnects from the server. You need to use /quitroom first when you are in a room.

- /quitroom - Quits your current room.

- /whoisroom - Gets your current opponent's nickname.

- /roomlist - Gets a list of room.

- /help - Gets commands.
